## Tracking for the Cloudlet Platform

[Piwik](http://piwik.org/) is the leading open source web analytics platform. It was designed to give valuable insights into website visitors, marketing campaigns etc., however,
we have taken a different approach with it. We are utilising it's tracking & reporting APIs, along with it's sophisticated UI, but for the purpose of tracking each data request
made against an OPENi users cloudlet.
Each user will then have their own web-frontend login to view this information.
